We will release our drawing dataset and analysis code in this repository.

The dataset consists of 1,498 tracings and freehand drawings by 110 participants for 100 image prompts. Our drawings are registered to the prompts and include vector-based timestamped strokes collected via stylus input.

More to come. Stay tuned!
